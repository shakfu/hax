"""Python binding for hax, built on libhax through cffi.

hax keeps its configuration, provider selection, and diagnostics in process-wide state, so this
module drives exactly one agent per process. Agent enforces that rather than letting a second
instance silently share the first one's settings.

Meson builds the _hax_cffi extension; nothing here compiles anything:

    meson setup build-embed -Dembed=true && meson compile -C build-embed

HAX_EXTENSION_DIR points at the directory holding it. Without that, the build directories beside
the source tree are searched, so a plain `meson compile` is enough to make `import hax` work.
