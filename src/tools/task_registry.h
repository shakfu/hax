/* Process-local registry of background tasks: shell commands that outlived their foreground
 * window and keep running detached from the tool call that started them. Each task owns the
 * child's process tree, the read end of its output pipe, and a spool file that accumulates the
 * complete output; a per-task drainer thread pumps pipe to spool.
 *
 * All entry points below run on the agent loop thread. Tasks never outlive the process:
 * task_registry_shutdown kills every remaining process tree.
 *
 * Output is delivered per task, only through task_wait_stream (and the launch report), capped
 * like synchronous tool output with a per-task cursor tracking what the model has seen.
 * Completion is announced separately by one-line status notes; an announced task stays
 * collectable until a wait delivers its remaining output, and only then is it forgotten. The
 * spool file stays on disk as the overflow escape hatch. */

/* Reject a proposed task name with an allocated recoverable error, or return NULL when it is
 * usable: short identifier characters only, not the reserved t<digits> shape, and not held by a
 * live task. Meant to run before the command starts, so a bad name has no side effects. */

 * task_name_error, or NULL) becomes the task id; unnamed tasks get "tN". spooled_bytes is what
 * the foreground window already wrote to the spool; binary marks NUL bytes seen so far;
 * pipe_eof records that the pipe already drained (the child closed its output but has not
 * exited). Returns the registry-owned id after taking ownership of the process, pipe_fd,
 * spool_fd, and spool_path, or NULL when the drainer thread cannot start — the caller then
 * retains ownership of all of them and should fall back to killing the command. */

 * wait on an already-finished task returns its remaining output immediately and forgets it.
 * With kill_on_timeout, an elapsed timeout instead stops the task (SIGTERM, the bash grace
