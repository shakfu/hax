# Build the fully static Linux release binary. Requires musl (glibc cannot link NSS statically),
# hence Alpine: runs there directly, elsewhere re-executes itself in an alpine container via
# podman. ARCH selects the container CPU; a foreign one emulates via qemu binfmt, slowly. The
# tested, stripped binary lands in BUILD_DIR (default build-static-<arch>) and in artifact-path
# when given.
